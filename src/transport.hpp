 * @brief Singapore Transport Network Optimization Algorithm Header
 * @author Ho Jing Rui
 * @date 28/9/2025
 *
 * @section description Description
 * Defines the SingaporeTransportOptimizer class that implements a divide-and-conquer
 * algorithm for public transport route optimization with time complexity T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n.
 * The algorithm models Singapore's geographical division into four regions (NE, NW, SE, SW)
 * and recursively optimizes transport routes while maintaining O(n^2) complexity.
 *
 * @section algorithm Algorithm Overview
 * - Divide: Split transport network into 4 quadrants (4T(n/2))
 * - Conquer: Recursively optimize routes within each quadrant
 * - Combine: Merge solutions with linear-time inter-region connectivity (+n)
 *
 * @section features Features
 * - Implements recurrence relation T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n
 * - Empirical complexity analysis with timing measurements
 * - Singapore-specific regional division
 * - Configurable network generation for testing
 *
 * @section usage Usage
 * #include "transport.hpp"
 * SingaporeTransportOptimizer optimizer(network_size);
 * int result = optimizer.optimizeTransport(network_matrix);
 * optimizer.analyzeComplexity();
 *
 * @section notes Notes
 * - Network sizes must be powers of 2 for proper division
 * - Algorithm designed for Singapore's geographical context
 * - Includes testing utilities for unit validation
